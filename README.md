# `elm-bcp47-parser` [![Build Status](https://github.com/miniBill/elm-bcp47-parser/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/miniBill/elm-bcp47-parser/actions?query=branch%3Amain)
This package parses BCP 47 language tags.

It is meant to be used as a companion to [dillonkearns/elm-bcp47-language-tag](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-bcp47-language-tag/latest), and it uses the types from that package for its results.
